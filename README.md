| EMBOSS Explorer             | [https://www.bioinformatics.nl/emboss-explorer/](https://www.bioinformatics.nl/emboss-explorer/)  | EMBOSS Explorer is a web-based tool for exploring the EMBOSS (European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite) package. It provides a user-friendly interface to execute various sequence analysis and manipulation tasks.                           |
| MAFFT Alignment Server      | [https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/index.html](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/index.html)  | The MAFFT Alignment Server is used for multiple sequence alignment. It allows you to upload a set of sequences and obtain a multiple sequence alignment in MSF format. Additionally, it can construct a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences and provide tree files for further analysis. |
